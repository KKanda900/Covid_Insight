# Covid-19 Insight 🦠

## Inspiration 🤔
My main inspiration for this project was so people can stay up to date with the rise of COVID-19 in America through text messages instead of an application that would take up space in their phone. 

## What it does ⚙️
Covid Insight is an application that has the incentive to keep people up to date with latest corona virus cases in America via text that communicates with a flask server application giving the apporiate responses based on the user.

## How to use it 🗒️
To use Covid Insight, follow these steps:
  1. Clone this repository
  2. Setup Ngrok on your system
  3. When you setup Ngrok, go to the directory thats in your machine that has ngrok and run **./ngrok http port number** to start the server
  4. Run **Application.py** in the terminal and people can start to recieve messages.

## How I built it 🔨
I built this project using Python, python libraries and Machine Learning (specifically Linear Regression). Python was used to built the application and to write the scripts. Some python specific libraries I used were:
  1. numpy
  2. matplotlib
  3. pandas
  4. sklearn (using their Machine Learning Linear Regression model)
  5. Flask
  6. Twilio

## Challenges I ran into 🚧
A major challenge I ran into when creating this project was learning about Machine Learning models and which one would be the best to measure the predictions for future cases in **n** amount of days.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 😄
I am proud to say I learned some aspects of Machine Learning that I didn't learn before and be confident enough to apply it to other projects in the future where applicable. 🎓
