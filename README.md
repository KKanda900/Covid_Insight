# Covid Insight 🦠

## Inspiration 🤔
My main insipiration for this project was so people can stay up to date with the rise of COVID-19 in America through text messages instead of an application that would take up space in their phone. 

## What it does ⚙️
Covid Insight is an application that has the incentive to keep people up to date with latest corona virus cases in America via text that communicates with a flask server application giving the apporiate responses based on the user.

## How to use it 🗒️
To use Covid Insight, follow these steps:
  1. Clone this repository
  2. Setup Ngrok on your system
    2a. When you setup Ngrok, go to the directory thats in your machine that has ngrok and run **./ngrok http <port forward number>** to start the server
  2. Run **Application.py** in the terminal and people can start to recieve messages.

## How I built it 🔨
The tools I used to complete this project is using Python for the back-end and ElectronJS framework for the front-end of this project. Also implemented Google's text to speech API to translate audio to text and Python's Natural Language Toolkit to process input from the user.

## Challenges I ran into 🚧
Major challenge I ran into at first was thinking of the approach because in the Batman series, he is one of the main people that helps Batman so thinking of a voice assistant that can replicate that would be tough.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of 😄
I am proud that I can say I made my voice assistance with a flair. Also, that I made a voice assistant for desktop users because we know not everyone likes Cortona. 😝
